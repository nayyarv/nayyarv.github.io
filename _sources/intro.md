## A Blog
 
 A redone blog for the 2020's. Since I like data science related stuff, having a jupyter book make my jupyter notebooks render well is much nicer.

 This doesn't sort by time, but I'll probably generate some kind of index to do this automatically for me eventually!

 Moving over some older blog posts and updating for the latest releases lol
